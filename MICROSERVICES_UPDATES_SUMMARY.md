- Added `clear_cart()` method and endpoints for order service integration

### 6. Order Service - Service Orchestration ✅
**Fixes**:
- Added cart clearing after successful order creation
- Implemented order notification sending via notification service
- Added service-to-service communication using httpx
- Created enhanced order service with complete orchestration

### 7. Shared Module - Persistent Audit Logging ✅
**Fixes**:
- Created `AuditLog` SQLAlchemy model for database storage
- Updated `AuditService.record_event()` to persist to database
- Added audit log retrieval methods
- Implemented structured audit logging

### 8. Admin Service - Complete Implementation ✅
**Created**:
- New admin service with all management endpoints
- Dashboard statistics aggregation from all services
- User, product, and order management endpoints
- Admin API key protection for all endpoints
- Service-to-service communication for data aggregation

### 9. Additional Improvements ✅
**Cart Service**:
- Added `/cart/{user_id}/clear` endpoint for internal service calls
- Implemented proper cache management

**Requirements**:
- Added `firebase-admin` to auth service dependencies
- Added `httpx` for service-to-service communication
- Added `supabase` for real-time tracking
