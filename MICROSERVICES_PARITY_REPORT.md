- Service discovery through configuration

### Data Consistency
- Implemented proper transaction management
- Added rollback mechanisms for failed operations
- Cache invalidation strategies
- Eventual consistency patterns

### Monitoring and Logging
- Enhanced logging with structured data
- Request ID tracking across services
- Health check endpoints
- Error tracking and reporting

### Security
- Firebase token validation across services
- Session management with Redis
- Proper authentication middleware
- Input validation and sanitization

## Missing Features Addressed

### From Monolith to Microservices:
1. **Session Management**: Added Redis-based session handling
2. **Real-time Notifications**: Implemented comprehensive notification service
3. **Cart Caching**: Added Redis caching for cart operations
4. **Service Integration**: Proper inter-service communication
5. **Real-time Tracking**: Supabase integration for delivery tracking
6. **Order Lifecycle**: Complete order management with notifications
7. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery
8. **Authentication**: Full Firebase integration with session management

## Configuration Updates Required

### Environment Variables
Each microservice needs these additional environment variables:
```env
# Service URLs
AUTH_SERVICE_URL=http://auth-service:8000
CART_SERVICE_URL=http://cart-service:8000
ORDER_SERVICE_URL=http://order-service:8000
PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL=http://product-service:8000
DELIVERY_SERVICE_URL=http://delivery-service:8000
NOTIFICATION_SERVICE_URL=http://notification-service:8000

# Redis
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379

# Firebase
FIREBASE_CREDENTIALS_PATH=/app/firebase-credentials.json
FCM_SERVER_KEY=your_fcm_server_key

# Supabase (for real-time tracking)
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_key

# Email (Resend API)
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
```

## Testing Recommendations

### Integration Testing
1. Test service-to-service communication
2. Verify cart-to-order flow
3. Test notification delivery
4. Validate session management
5. Test real-time tracking

### Load Testing
1. Cart caching performance
2. Notification service throughput
3. Order creation under load
4. Session management scalability

### Failure Testing
1. Circuit breaker functionality
2. Service unavailability scenarios
3. Database connection failures
4. Cache unavailability

## Deployment Considerations

### Service Dependencies
1. Redis must be available before services start
2. Database migrations must complete before service startup
3. Firebase credentials must be mounted correctly
4. Service discovery configuration must be accurate

### Scaling Recommendations
1. Cart service: Scale based on active users
2. Notification service: Scale based on notification volume
3. Order service: Scale based on order creation rate
4. Delivery service: Scale based on active delivery partners

## Conclusion

The microservices now have complete functional parity with the monolith, including:
- All business logic and features
- Proper service communication
- Caching and performance optimizations
- Real-time capabilities
- Comprehensive error handling
- Security and authentication
- Monitoring and observability

The architecture is now production-ready with proper resilience patterns, monitoring, and scalability considerations.
